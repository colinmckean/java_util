A HashMap provides an unsortted, unordered Map.
A HashMap implements a Map Interface.
They use a key value pair silmilar to other programming languages.
With this HashMap we can search for values based on keys or ask for a collection of just keys or just values.
HashMaps are unordered and unsorted, this gives faster performance.
for a ordered map LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order although it will give poorer performance for adding and removing elements.
